The field verificationCode stores a random, unique String which is generated in the registration process and will be used in the verification process. Once registered, the enabled status of a user is false (disabled) so the user can’t login if he has not activated account by checking email and click on the verification link embedded in the email.

public boolean isEnabled() {
		Users users = new Users();
		return users.isEnabled();
		
	}
	Here, we override the isEnabled() method that returns the user’s enabled status with value from database, so Spring Security will inject login if the user has not verified his account, i.e. the error message “User is disabled” in the login page.
